fbcalendar
==========
This was my solution for a problem given by Facebook's Front End Engineering Intern interview. The problem was that given a set of objects that had a start and end time, render a calendar such that none of the events overlapped, events that collided in time took up the same width, and events would default take up the maximum width available.
